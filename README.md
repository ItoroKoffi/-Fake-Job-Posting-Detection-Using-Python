# **Data Analysis with Python**
Visualizing job postings dataset to determine which industry has the highest number of fake job postings.

## **Approach** 
- Python programming language was utilized to perform this visualization.
- Imported necessery libraries.
- Imported dataset into coding environment (google colab).
- Analyzed dataset columns to determine the industry column of interest.
- Used groupby to visualize number of fraudulent and non-fraudulent jobs.
- Used seaborn and matplotlib to plot count of fraudulent and non-fraudulen jobs to number of job postings.
- Performed unique count of number of industries available in datset, result showed 132 industries present.
- Because of the large number of industries available, only top 10 were considered for visualization.
- Visualized top 10 industries with fake job posting in table format.
- Visualized top 10 industries  with fake job posting in barplot using seaborn and matplotlib.
